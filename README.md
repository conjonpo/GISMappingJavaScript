# GIS Mapping

## Overview

The purpose of this website is to demonstrate what can be done with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. I have made a map of the birth places mine and my wife's ancestors back seven generations in ArcGIS Pro for another class, but I wanted this map to be on a website and pop-ups to appear when you click on a marker. Since I am a GIS Technician, this project interested me since I want to know what can be done with interactive maps on the web. This is will be a useful skill for work.

## Development Environment

* Glitch
* ArcGIS Online
* ArcGIS Pro

Glitch is an online service where HTML, CSS and JavaScript can be written and preview and can be connected to GitHub (though I had trouble connecting to GitHub, I had to download my HTML file and then upload it to this repository). ArcGIS Pro is what I made the map in originally and it was uploaded to ArcGIS Online. A license for both ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Pro is required to complete this the way I did. I acquired a license through my university.

## Execution

The first step is to [follow this link](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/javascript/create-a-starter-app/) and put in the basic JavaScript code into an HTML file on Glitch.
